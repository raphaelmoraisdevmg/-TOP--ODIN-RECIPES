    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground chuck</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>
        <li>For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.</li>
        <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:</li>
        <li>Set out a baking sheet lined with wax paper or foil to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink slightly during in the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press an indentation in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.

            You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</li>
