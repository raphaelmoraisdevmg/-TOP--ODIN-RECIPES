            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in rice vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. 
            Season with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. 
            Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

                Whisk eggs, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. 
                Pour about 1/4 of the mixture in a thin layer in a large greased skillet over medium heat. Cook without stirring until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Roll into a log and set in one side of the pan. Repeat with 1/4 of the egg mixture, rolling each log into a new log, to create one large log.
